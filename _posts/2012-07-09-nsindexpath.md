I was a fan of `NSIndexPath` before their `UIKit` extensions dropped. Now if you go see them in concert, it's overrun by teenagers with those Hot Topic shirts with Scott Forstall's face on them (you know the ones). Sure, they know all the words to `row` and `section`, but any deeper into the catalog, and they're lost. Back to sexting on their iPhones.
